# Lovecraftian-Eliza
A small implementation of natural language engineering by creating a personal version of Eliza, that responds to requests to book a ticket to varios locations, set in a Lovecraftian alter-universe.
# DISCLAIMER
I do not own any of the Lovecraftian references in this project. Credits go to the author.
